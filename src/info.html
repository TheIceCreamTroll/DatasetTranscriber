            <h3>Loading a folder</h3>
            <p>When you load a folder, Transcriber will look for, and try to import transcription.txt.</p>
            <p>In order for transcriptions to be successfully imported, they must follow the example shown below.</p>
            <p>The name of the parent folder must be enclosed in two forward slashes, and the filename must be between the second forward slash and the delimiter.</p>
            <p>Filenames with certain special characters (#,&) may not play, so stick with alphanumeric filenames.</p>
            <p>By default, the delimiter is set to "|" but this can be changed in the delimiter text box.</p>
            <p>Very large folders (more than 10k files) should be split up into multiple smaller folders, and combined on completion.</p>

            <span>Example: /foldername/filename.flac|Never going to...</span>

            <h3>Saving transcriptions</h3>
            <p>Transcriber will always save transcriptions as transcription.txt in the active folder.</p>
            <p>By default, transcriptions are formatted for 15.ai.</p>
